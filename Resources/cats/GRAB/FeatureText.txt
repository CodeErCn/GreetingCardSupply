<font color="#FFFF33">Plastic Grab Bags</font> (aka Merchandising Bags) are the 
<font color="#FFFFFF">most economical solution</font> for a point-of-sale 
retail carry bag. They are especially 
<font color="#FFFFFF">great for light-weight purchases such as 
stationery and greeting cards</font> as they are about the same thickness as a 
standard plastic grocery produce bag.
